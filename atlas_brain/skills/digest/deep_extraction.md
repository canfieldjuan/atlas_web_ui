# Deep Review Extraction

You are a product review analyst performing deep extraction. Given a product review with its basic classification, extract 32 structured fields across three sections for content generation and market intelligence.

## Input

```json
{
  "review_text": "Full review text...",
  "summary": "Review title/summary",
  "rating": 1.0,
  "product_name": "Acme Widget Pro 3000",
  "brand": "Acme",
  "root_cause": "hardware_defect",
  "severity": "critical",
  "pain_score": 8.5
}
```

## Section A: Product Analysis (10 fields)

### sentiment_aspects (required, array)
What specific aspects does the reviewer feel strongly about? Max 6.
Each element: `{"aspect": string, "sentiment": "positive"|"negative"|"mixed", "detail": string}`
Aspects: quality, durability, noise, value, design, ease_of_use, performance, packaging, size, weight, appearance, smell, temperature, compatibility, customer_service, warranty, other.

### feature_requests (required, array of strings)
Wishes, suggestions, improvements the reviewer wants. Look for "I wish...", "if only...", "should have...", "would be better if...". Empty array if none.

### failure_details (required, object or null)
If the review describes a product failure, extract: `{"timeline": string, "failed_component": string, "failure_mode": string, "dollar_amount_lost": number|null}`. Null if no failure described.
- timeline: "2 weeks", "3 months", "day one", etc. as stated
- failed_component: the specific part that failed
- failure_mode: how it failed (stopped working, overheated, cracked, leaked, etc.)
- dollar_amount_lost: total cost if mentioned (product price + shipping + replacement cost)

### product_comparisons (required, array)
Other products the reviewer mentions. Each element: `{"product_name": string, "direction": "switched_to"|"switched_from"|"considered"|"compared", "context": string}`. Empty array if none mentioned.

### product_name_mentioned (required, string)
The actual product name as used in the review text. If the reviewer names the product, use their exact words. If not explicitly named, use the product_name from input. Empty string only if completely unknown.

### buyer_context (required, object)
`{"use_case": string, "buyer_type": string, "price_sentiment": "expensive"|"fair"|"cheap"|"not_mentioned"}`
- use_case: why they bought it (home office, gaming, gift, replacement, etc.)

- price_sentiment: how they feel about the price relative to value

### quotable_phrases (required, array of strings)
1-3 exact verbatim quotes from the review text that would work as proof in an article. Must be EXACT text from the review -- do not paraphrase. Pick the most impactful, specific phrases. Empty array if the review has no quotable content.

### would_repurchase (required, boolean or null)
Would the reviewer buy this product again? True if they express satisfaction or loyalty. False if they say "never again", "returning", "switching to X". Null if unclear.

### external_references (required, array)
Mentions of forums, YouTube videos, Reddit posts, warranty claims, customer service interactions, other review sites. Each element: `{"source": string, "context": string}`. Empty array if none.

### positive_aspects (required, array of strings)

## Example

Input:
```json
{
  "review_text": "I'm a nurse and bought this for 12-hour shifts. The Acme Widget Pro looked great and the price was right at $49. Saw it on a YouTube review comparing top 3 options -- went with this over BrandX because it was $30 cheaper. After just 3 weeks the power button stopped responding completely. I tried the reset procedure from their YouTube channel but nothing worked. Customer service was helpful but couldn't fix it. One unit got extremely hot -- worried about fire risk near my desk. I bought 2 of these originally. Now switching to BrandX Model 5 which my colleague recommended. I posted about it on Reddit and others have the same issue. I wish they had used better quality switches. If they fix the firmware I'd consider giving them another chance.",

- product_comparisons and consideration_set must only include products ACTUALLY mentioned.
- community_mentions must only reference platforms explicitly mentioned in the review.
- safety_flag: only flag genuine physical danger, not general product failures.
- estimated_qty in bulk_purchase_signal must be an integer or null, never a string.
- Keep sentiment_aspects to max 6 -- pick the most important ones.
- Always output valid JSON only -- no prose, no markdown code fences.
