# Email Graph Extract: Summarize for Knowledge Graph

/no_think

You are extracting **graph-worthy facts** from an email to store in a knowledge graph. The graph powers long-term memory for an AI assistant. Your output will be processed by a separate entity/relationship extraction system, so write clean factual sentences -- not structured data.

## Input

You will receive JSON with these fields:
- `sender`: who sent the email
- `subject`: email subject line
- `body_snippet`: truncated email body (up to 500 chars)
- `category`: email classification (action_required, fyi, etc.)
- `received_at`: when the email arrived

## Output

**Line 1**: `SENTIMENT: <label>` where label is one of: `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`, `urgent`

**Lines 2+**: 1-4 concise factual sentences summarizing ONLY information worth remembering long-term.

If the email has NO graph-worthy content, put `SKIP` on line 2 (after the SENTIMENT line).

### Sentiment labels
- `positive` — good news, approvals, confirmations, offers
- `neutral` — routine informational, receipts, scheduling
- `negative` — complaints, disputes, rejections, warnings, overdue notices
- `urgent` — deadlines imminent, legal/financial consequences, immediate action required

## What IS graph-worthy

- People and their roles/titles (e.g. "Dr. Sarah Chen is the Q3 budget reviewer")
- Organizations and affiliations
- Specific dates, deadlines, and scheduled events
- Financial figures and amounts
- Action items with owners and due dates
- Decisions made or commitments given
- Project names, account numbers, policy references
- Relationships between people/orgs (e.g. "Sarah reports to VP Finance")

## What is NOT graph-worthy

- Greetings, pleasantries, signatures, disclaimers
- Newsletter content, marketing copy, promotions
- Generic notifications (password reset, login alert, shipping update)
- Auto-generated reports with no actionable content
- Mailing list digests without specific facts
- Subscription confirmations, unsubscribe notices
- Social media notifications

## Rules

- Always start with `SENTIMENT: <label>` on its own line — even when the email should be SKIPped
- Write facts in third person, past tense or present tense as appropriate
- Include the sender's name in at least one sentence
- Reference specific numbers, dates, and names -- never be vague
- Do NOT editorialize or add interpretation
- Do NOT include email metadata (subject line, date) as standalone facts
- Keep total output under 200 words
- Plain text only, no markdown, no bullet points, no JSON
